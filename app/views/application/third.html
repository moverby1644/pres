       		<p>Thomas Jefferson was an American Founding Father, the principal author of the Declaration of Independence (1776), and the third President of the United States. He was an ardent proponent of democracy and embraced the principles of republicanism and the rights of the individual with worldwide influence. He served in the Continental Congress, representing Virginia, and then served as a wartime Governor of Virginia (1779–1781). In May 1785, he became the United States Minister to France and later the first United States Secretary of State (1790–1793) serving under President George Washington. In opposition to Alexander Hamilton's Federalism, Jefferson and his close friend, James Madison, organized the Democratic-Republican Party, and later resigned from Washington's cabinet. Elected president in what Jefferson called the "Revolution of 1800", he oversaw acquisition of the vast Louisiana Territory from France, and sent out the Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore the new west.</p>
